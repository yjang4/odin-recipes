        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup made from miso paste, dashi (broth). Next to the broth and miso paste, there are often some additional ingredients such as vegetables, seaweed, and tofu. Miso soup is often served as a part of Japanese-style meals along with white rice and grilled fish. The brown soup might look unfamiliar for those who have never tried it before, but the gentle taste can be everyoneâ€™s favorite regardless of your heritage, nationality or age! If you get an opportunity to stay at a traditional Japanese ryokan, it is probably served for breakfast, to warm your body from inside and start the day smoothly!</p>
